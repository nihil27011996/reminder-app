        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This Reminder Management Application is designed to help users create, display, and manage reminders efficiently. It utilizes modern JavaScript features, including ES6 classes, to encapsulate behaviors associated with reminders. The application is an exemplary demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using classes, encapsulation, and inheritance to interact with the DOM and manage application state.</p>
