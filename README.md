Reminder Management Application
Overview
This Reminder Management Application is designed to help users create, display, and manage reminders efficiently. It utilizes modern JavaScript features, including ES6 classes, to encapsulate behaviors associated with reminders. The application showcases a strong example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making extensive use of classes, encapsulation, and methods to interact with the DOM and manage state.

Features
Create Reminders: Users can add new reminders with details such as the title, description, and specific time.
Display Reminders: Each reminder is displayed in a visually distinct block that shows its details and status.
Dynamic Interaction: Users can interact with reminders to toggle their details, mark them as complete, or see more information.
Local Data Fetching: Loads reminder data from a local JSON file to populate the application's UI upon startup.
Responsive Design: Implements basic styling to ensure that the application is usable across various devices and screen sizes.
Technical Description
The application is structured around two main classes:

Reminder Class:

Handles the creation of reminder elements in the DOM.
Manages individual reminder interactions such as marking as complete and toggling visibility of details.
Each reminder is an instance of this class, encapsulating all related properties and methods.
App Class:

Manages the overall application state.
Responsible for fetching initial data and integrating new reminders into the application.
Handles UI interactions for adding new reminders and closing the reminder addition form.
Methodology
OOP Principles: The use of classes and encapsulation allows for clean and maintainable code structure.
DOM Manipulation: Directly interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to reflect changes in the application's state.
Event Handling: Uses event listeners to handle user interactions like clicks, enabling dynamic functionality within the application.
Setup and Running
To run the application:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a modern web browser.
Interact with the pre-loaded data or add new reminders as needed.
Future Enhancements
Persistence: Integrate with local storage or a backend database to save and retrieve reminders.
Notification System: Add a system to alert users when reminders are due.
User Accounts: Implement user authentication to manage personal reminders.
