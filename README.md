    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This Reminder Management Application is designed to help users create, display, and manage reminders efficiently. It utilizes modern JavaScript features, including ES6 classes, to encapsulate behaviors associated with reminders. The application showcases a strong example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making extensive use of classes, encapsulation, and methods to interact with the DOM and manage state.</p>

        <h2>Technical Description</h2>
        <p>The application is structured around two main classes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reminder Class:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handles the creation of reminder elements in the DOM.</li>
                    <li>Manages individual reminder interactions such as marking as complete and toggling visibility of details.</li>
                    <li>Each reminder is an instance of this class, encapsulating all related properties and methods.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>App Class:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manages the overall application state.</li>
                    <li>Responsible for fetching initial data and integrating new reminders into the application.</li>
                    <li>Handles UI interactions for adding new reminders and closing the reminder addition form.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Further technical aspects include OOP principles, DOM manipulation, and event handling for a dynamic user experience.</p>
